SPEAKER_31:
Right, Vicky and Marcello, we arranged this tutorial so you could give me an update of

SPEAKER_26:
your joint project, the case report on the work you've been doing at a local sports club.

SPEAKER_23:
Is that right?

SPEAKER_32:
Yes, that's it.

SPEAKER_24:
It's Stars Club, the one that's been in the news a lot lately.

SPEAKER_25:
It's not that far from the Kennedy campus.

SPEAKER_19:
Right.

SPEAKER_29:
Yes, I have it here.

SPEAKER_33:
Far away.

SPEAKER_30:
Well, at first, we were going to look only at the management structure of the club, but

SPEAKER_16:
we decided to include what's made it more successful than other local clubs.

SPEAKER_27:
The club's success has not just come from its many sporting achievements.

SPEAKER_20:
It's also attracting so many young people.

SPEAKER_11:
We talked to staff and members and-

SPEAKER_17:
Ah.

SPEAKER_21:
How many people did you talk to?

SPEAKER_14:
There are just over 600 members overall, and 23 staff, including freelance workers.

SPEAKER_12:
So far, we've talked to, um, ooh, about 173 people.

SPEAKER_18:
Didn't you think of giving a questionnaire to everyone?

SPEAKER_22:
We decided against it.

SPEAKER_15:
Why was that?

SPEAKER_05:
Well, we thought that face-to-face interviews, however brief, would be

SPEAKER_28:
better, as we'd be able to probe people gently to give us more details if need be.

SPEAKER_08:
And you're finding so far?

SPEAKER_13:
The club's actually very well run.

SPEAKER_10:
The managers are very focused and work well together.

SPEAKER_06:
And the management team also includes representatives from the various teams at the club.

SPEAKER_07:
This means that when decisions are made, they're not taken in isolation of the members, as

SPEAKER_09:
so often happens in other organisations.

SPEAKER_03:
The management team's in touch with the members, and vice versa.

SPEAKER_04:
You seem to have learned a lot so far.

SPEAKER_02:
I agree.

SPEAKER_01:
It's a really exhilarating experience being there.

SPEAKER_00:
I can't wait to go in every day.
